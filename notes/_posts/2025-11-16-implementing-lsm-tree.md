## Timeline

- **2025-11-16**:

  - I understand the basics and the theory about LSM Trees implementation. It all starts understanding and implementing one of the most important components of LSM Trees: the memtable, memtable is implemented using an in-memory sorted data structure: AVL Tree, Skip List, Red-Black Tree, etc.
  - I am focusing in implementing the memtable using a Skip List.
  - resources:

    - Data Structures and Algorithms in Python, book. I have read this book before so, i am starting with reviewing relevant chapters.
